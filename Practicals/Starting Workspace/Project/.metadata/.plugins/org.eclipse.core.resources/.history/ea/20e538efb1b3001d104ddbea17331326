/* Lesson 94 Training vs Test and Holdout Data
 * 
 * Lets go further in our model and evaluate if its good. Recall, last thing we did was NOT meaningful. We looked at predictions by the model for our underlying data. We used one set 
 * of data to build the model and then looked at what the model predicted for the same set of data. Because the model was built using this data, we expect the predictions to be good.
 * But building a model to see if its good at predicting outcomes is mainly for when we dont know the outcomes. Better test would be to see how it performs with DIFFERENT set of data.
 * Data NOT used to fit the model. Normal approach is to split data into two data sets. One is to build model, other is to test model. SO then we can see if the model is good based
 * on how the model performs with data for outcomes that did NOT build the model / that we dont know. Data used to fit the model is known as training data (used to train the model).
 * Data used to assess model for accuracy is test data. Our model only uses 20 rows of data. Not really enough to split into two smaller sets so lets switch over to real world
 * larger data.
 * 
 * We will use a dataset from kaggle website it is called House Sales in King County, USA. Why is
