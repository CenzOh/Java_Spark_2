/* Lesson 99 setting linear regression parameters
 * 
 * We will be talking about model fitting parameters. In last few chapters we saw the following warning:
 * 
 * WARN WeightedLeastSquares: regParam is zero, which might cause numerical instability and overfitting.
 * 
 * We must deal with this now. THis error message says we havent supplied a value for regParam. The process Spark uses how to come up with coefficients of the model to build is
 * by using a number of different regression analysis methods.
