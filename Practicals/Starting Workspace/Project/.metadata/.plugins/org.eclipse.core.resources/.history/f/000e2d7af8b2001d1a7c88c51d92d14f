/* Lesson 90 Intro Linear Regression
 * 
 * We will learn how to build our first model which is Linear Regression. Lets deep dive into what it can be used for. WARN - code in this chapter is NOT going to be complete
 * and NOT good quality model YET. We will start slow and build up our knowledge. To recap we have seen general form of the linear regression model:
 * 
 * Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + B3X3 + ...
 * NoOfReps = 3 + 0.4*height + 0.2*weight + 0.5*age
 * 
 * Y - label like NumOfReps
 * B0 - intercept like 3
 * B1, B2, B3 - coefficients such as 0.4, 0.2, 0.5
 * X1, X2, X3 - features like height weight age
 * 
 * We want to produce this formula to predict a label based on using an intercept to calculate a num and then a series of coefficients for each of the features of our model.
 * We want to come up with the formula like the example above. Linear Regression can predict a continuous numerical value. This is the label. The value we want to predict will be
 * a number with an infinite range of possible values. Ex - predict price of house, probability customer pays back loan. Can use linear regression on these examples. 
 * We had the simple example of the predicting number of reps based on height, age, weight.
