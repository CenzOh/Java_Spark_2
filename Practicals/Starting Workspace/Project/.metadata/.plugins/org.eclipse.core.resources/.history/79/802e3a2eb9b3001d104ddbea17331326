/* Lesson 98 Assessing Model Accuracy with R2 and RMSE
 * 
 * There are ways to assess whether a model is good or not other than looking at the predictions and comparing to labels. Actual statistical measures. Which statistical measures
 * that are available depends on the model. FOr linear regression, we have two: root mean squared error RMSE and the r squared value. We wont go into detail about what they are. 
 * Not difficult to calculate tho. One thing to know, for RMSE know that the smaller the number the better. FOr R2 its a measure between 0 and 1, so closer to 1 is better.
