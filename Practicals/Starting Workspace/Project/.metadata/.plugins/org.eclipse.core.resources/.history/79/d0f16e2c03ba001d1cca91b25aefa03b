/* Lesson 137 Structured Streaming Overview
 * 
 * We experienced spark structured streaming with abstraction of DStream. lets us use RDDs. API with weird RDD like flavor. Under teh hood spark UI uses RDDs built for each batch
 * More recently new api introduced called structured streaming. This gives us access to the spark sql model. We can use dataframes, datasets, or sql api whatever we like.
 * 
 * Spark docs have a separate section for structured streaming. Again obv difference between structured stream and DStreams are the APIs. However it look slike dev defforts are
 * directed to structured streaming.
