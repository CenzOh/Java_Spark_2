/* Lesson 119 Overview and Matrix Factorization
 * 
 * This is our second unsupervised model to look at. It is useful for recommender systems. Lets clarify what a recommender system is. Remember, our last model can be used for this!
 * Suppose we run an online music streaming service. Lots of song in the database and we used k means clustering to group each song into a category based on features like which country
 * the performer is in, tempo of song, length, etc.
 * 
 * songID | Genre | Performer Country | Tempo (BPM) | Length | Loudness
 * 1	  | Pop	  | USA 		      | 140         | 195    | -8.0
 * ...
 * 
 * Every time a customer listens to one of our songs, we record wich cateogry that song comes from. So we build it up each user to see which songs were in a particular cluster than
 * another cluster
 * 
 * ... Loudness | Cluster
 * ... 0 	    | 0
 * 
 * UserID | Song of CHoice cluster
 * 1 	  | 0,0,1,0,1
 * 
 * Once we get all the info, we can make some recommendation.
