/* Lesson 131 Using Kafka Event Simulator
 * 
 * Now our kafka server is setup. We can create our first kafka topic. We called it view records. We will be working for a video streaming platform such as YouTube. Idea is to track
 * which are the most popular videos / most viewings. Not counting just individual viewing. COunt popularity second by second. As a user watches the video, an event will be sent
 * from the video player to the kafka player. We can do it by 5 seconds. Decent level of granularity. Events stream to our servers, capture them.
 * 
 * We have a viewing-figures-generation which can simulate the video streaming platform. Import the proejct into the worksapce, can do it with create new java project,
 * name is viewing-figures-generation, auto configure JRE. The aim of the project  is to simulate the events and send to kafka server. 
 * The pom.xml only has dependency of kafka. Allows us to call kafka from java code. Run the pom.xml as a maven build like usual.
