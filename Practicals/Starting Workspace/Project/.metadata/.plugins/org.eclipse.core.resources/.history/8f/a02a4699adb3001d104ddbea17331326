/* Lesson 93 Model Fitting
 * 
 * We are ready to build the model. Lets go through an overview of the process. Each model type in spark has a helper object to create the model. For linear regression this obj is
 * called LinearRegression. We will create a new linear regression and set some properties / attributes. We will not do that right now, will do it later. THen we have a method
 * called .fit() which takes a dataset (in correct format) with a col of labels and col of features, .fit() will result in new obj which is the actual fitted model.
 * It will be type LinearRegressionModel. LRM has some properties we can inspect. We want to look at intercept and coefficient to find the formula that was created for us.
 * There is a mehtod of the model called transform which lets us pass in the dataset of label and features and outputs same data with new col, predictions. Predictions col is what we
 * get when we apply the formula we made in the model.
