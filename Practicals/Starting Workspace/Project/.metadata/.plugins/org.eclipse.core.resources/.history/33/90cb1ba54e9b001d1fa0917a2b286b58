	//Leson 25 why do sorts not work with foreach?
/* We will address the common misconception with the sort transformation that we used in the previous chapter. We will look at the Coalesce function. 
 * Last time we built the solution which processes a (relatively) big data file. Real life can be arbitrarily big. Processes and lists top 10 important keywords. Reads the subtitles of the course
 * We avoided the common trap with the sort routine. Many people new to spark fall into the trap. Lets address it!
 * 
 * What are we talking about? Lets recap, we did a lot of transformations and ended with a sorting transformation and finish by taking first ten results of RDD. 
 * Because we already did so, that will take the ten most popular key words. HOWEVER we did NOT have to do a take!!
