/* Lesson 114 Overview of Decision Trees
 * 
 * Next model is decision trees. There are two types in spark we will cover both. Decision trees are cool! Outcome is easy to understand and easy to translate to english. 
 * Ex - is it an existing customer? - yes -> low risk
 * 									| - no - is customer in high risk country? - yes -> high risk ....
 * 
 * Goal of building a DT with ML is to end up with a human readable flowchart which we can use as a decision making tool. The above example is a great example. Looking to find if
 * the transaction will be fraudulent or genuine. Idea is ML process comes up with a process which is a set of rules. If you ask right questions, you can categorize each transaction
 * with an outcome based on these features within the questions. THis example is a boolean example but DTs can have multiple categories.
 * 
 * DTs will be more complicated but this is just a simple example. THe example we will be covering is the following: VPP offers a free trial, we want to know half way through the trial
 * period if the customer will become a paying customer or not. If not, we can do something to encourage them to become a paying customer. Can find this out with the DT. Build
 * one with the features available to us to find out if they will be paying customers or not. We will be using the file vppFreeTrials.csv
