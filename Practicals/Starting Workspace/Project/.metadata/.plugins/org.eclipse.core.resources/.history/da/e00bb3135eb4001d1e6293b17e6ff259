/* Lesson 101 Describing the Features
 * 
 * We will talk about how we select the parameters to build our model. Our current dataset has a ton of fields. We dont know which fields are good predictors of our outcomes.
 * The process to select suitable vairables for input into the model is a separate science so we will simply go over a high level overview of basic principles.
 * 
 * First issue, eliminate dependent variables. We dont want variables that DEPEND on the variable we are trying to predict (price). This should not be the case in our data set.
 * Imagine though that there was a field called sales tax. It contains amount of tax we would have to pay to buy the property. Sales tax is a percentage of that property.
 * This is a dependent variable.
