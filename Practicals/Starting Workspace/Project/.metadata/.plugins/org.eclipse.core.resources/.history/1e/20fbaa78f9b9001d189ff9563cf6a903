/* Lesson 131 Using Kafka Event Simulator
 * 
 * Now our kafka server is setup. We can create our first kafka topic. We called it view records. We will be working for a video streaming platform such as YouTube. Idea is to track
 * which are the most popular videos / most viewings. Not counting just individual viewing. COunt popularity second by second. As a user watches the video, an event will be sent
 * from the video player to the kafka player. We can do it by 5 seconds. Decent level of granularity. Events stream to our servers, capture them.
 * 
 * We have a viewing-figures-generation which can simulate the video streaming platform.
