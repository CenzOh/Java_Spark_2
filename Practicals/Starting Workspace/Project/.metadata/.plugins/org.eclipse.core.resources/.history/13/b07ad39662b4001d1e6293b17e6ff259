/* Lesson 102 Correlation Features
 * 
 * Idea of correlation is, we ask Spark what is correlation between sqft living (living space) and value we are trying to predict. Spakr gives us a number between -1 and 1.
 * 0 - no correlation / no relationship
 * 1 - strong correlation
 * -1 - strong correlation
 * 
 * 1 means size of property increase, price increase. -1 means size of property increases, price DECREASES. A feature with a strong correlation is a good parameter for our model.
 * Feature with no correlation / close to 0 not good in our model. Lets find out what correlations are for each input variable. Do this with .stat() method
