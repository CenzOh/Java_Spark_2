/* Lesson 129 Overview of Kafka
 * 
 * Other tahn set up streaming and start process, analysis, filters, maps, reduce by key same thing we would do in spark. Great but our demo was using a brittle socket connection.
 * Wouldnt be doing that in real life. Lets switch to common component in streaming architecture, apache kafka. Kafka is used in combo with spark when it comes to streaming,
 * we will have a basic overview of it. Not deep detail. High level. 
 * 
 * What is kafka and what can it do? Can view the home page on https://kafka.apache.org Doesnt give too much to explain it.
