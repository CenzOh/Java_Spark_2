/* Lesson 127 Spark UI for Spark Streaming
 * 
 * So even tho we have a continuous stream with the log messages, transaction logs, event records, etc. We see that spark streaming captures these events and groups them into batches.
 * We can set the size of the batches. They are created in infinite fashion. THey are under the hood at a programming level. We work at an abstraction level called DStream which is 
 * a collection of these batches.
 * 
 * The outputs we see are the results from the latest of those batches. Look at how we can gather together aggregated results from earlier batches as well. Under the hood, each of these batches is 
 * nothing more than an RDD.
