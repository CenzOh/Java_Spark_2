/* Lesson 63 In Memory Data
 * Recall that we used the parallelize method to initialize a java RDD with basic in-memory data that was seeded from a list. When working up a query, may be useful to have
 * a set of hardcoded data in memory data like what we did with RDD. Thats how we could make up a unit test like J QUery. Lets look at a semi realistic dataset.
 * Want to be familiar with more common scenarios like pulling in data from big text files, data dumps, log files. Remember in RDD section we made a regular java list, this was
 * an in-memory list and we added some data to it to set up initial RDD> lets see how to do it in Spark SQL. Advantage of this over reading in a text file is that we can run
 * unit tests.
 * List inMemory = new ArrayList(); //version in RDDs.
